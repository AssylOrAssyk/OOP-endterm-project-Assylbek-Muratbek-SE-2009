# OOP-endterm-project-Assylbek-Muratbek-SE-2009
In this project, I created a table of university students, our AITU. My project has functions how to add a student string having: barcode, first name, last name, and student group; Remove a student from the list by barcode; Show the entire table from pgAdmin 4, as well as show the student's grade by the barcode.
The project has 4 classes, 1 of which is abstract. And two tables.
I created a project in Intelij Comunity and then sent it to Ultimate.
